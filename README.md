## Description of the project:
### Preferable environment to be used is: MS Azure.
### Come up with Python based data processing pipeline with data preparation & processing functional workflow steps as follows : 
1. Load an image dataset from Laptop to Azure compute instance
    - Run following transformation on the data (each image)
        - Flip the image horizontally and vertically
        - Rotate it by 30 degrees
        - Blur it by 25% and 50%
    - Store the transformed images into an output folder.
    - Describe an easy way to visualize the output data.
 

2. Publish the above pipeline application to be used by others in the public cloud environment with proper deployment instructions.
    - Deployment instructions should cover scripted way to bring up infra in the cloud (VMs and storage etc..)
    - Suggest DevOps best practices to be followed while deploying pipeline.

3. Provide what kind of improvements and feature enhancement can be done on top of initial pipeline functionality.
